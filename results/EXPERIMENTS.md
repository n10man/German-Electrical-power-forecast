# Experiments log

Per experiment: hypothesis, the ONE change, command, validation metrics, keep/revert rule (written BEFORE results), decision, commit hash.
Splits are by time only. Test period is sealed until Phase 6. Max 10 experiments per feature group.

## B0/B1 — Baselines (reference points, validation only)
- Hypothesis: simple seasonal-naive forecasts set the bar any model must beat.
- Change: none (B0 = same hour yesterday = lag_24h; B1 = same hour last week = lag_168h). Both only use load known >= 24h ahead.
- Command: `python scripts/baselines.py`
- Keep/revert rule (written before results): baselines are kept as reference. In Phase 3 a model is kept for a zone only if its validation MAE is lower than the BEST baseline's MAE for that zone by at least 5%; otherwise revert.
- Metrics: see results/baselines_val.csv and the section below (filled after running).
- Decision / commit: recorded below.

**B0/B1 results (validation 2024-11-08..2025-11-07, MWh/h):** best baseline per zone is B1 (last week):
50Hertz MAE 941 (MAPE 8.3%), Amprion 989 (5.2%), TenneT 798 (5.1%), TransnetBW 447 (7.1%). B0 (yesterday) is worse everywhere (MAE 634-1427). Full table: results/baselines_val.csv.
Decision: both kept as references. Bar for Phase 3 per the rule above (MAE <= 0.95 x B1): 50Hertz 894, Amprion 940, TenneT 758, TransnetBW 425.
